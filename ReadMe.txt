VETAMR_DB contains all the database files used for identifying virulence factor, antimicrobial resistance and serology genes in VET_AMR isolate collection

SRST2_VFDB.fasta is the original database from Mark Shembri's lab file Brian used for the sequence typing of VF genes

SRST2_removal lists stepwise removal of virulence genes from analysis based and reason why it was deleted at the time e.g. hypothetical protein 

VF_PCR.fasta is the database I created to discern pathotypes in silico (originally mplx PCR)

The folder virulencefinder contains the database used to sequence type VF genes using the gui CGE

EcOH.fasta is the original database used to discern OH serology by read mapping to flagellin/flippase alleles

KTestDNA.fasta was the initial database used to discern K capsule serology. It had a very limited range and was repeated 

formatted_wzi_wzc_db.fasta was the database used to discern capsule serology by read mapping to wzi and wzc Capsule alleles

The folder resfinder contains the databases used to sequence type ARG genes using the CGE gui

The folder plasmidfinder contains the databases used to sequence type the plasmids using the CGE gui and the published reference plasmids controls used to compare with
